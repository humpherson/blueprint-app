Prompt primer for ChatGPT 4:

I want to continue working on my Blueprint App. It's a Next.js project that creates and manages service blueprints, currently live at https://blueprint.objetd.co.uk. Last time, we added features like stage reordering and inline editing.

The app structure is as follows:
/public // Static assets
/components // Reusable React components
└─ /dialogs // Dialog components (Edit, Delete confirmations)
└─ /stage // Components related to individual stages
└─ /help // Components like InfoColumn for extra information
/context // React context for managing blueprint state
/pages // Next.js pages
└─ index.js // Main application entry point
/data // Default data and examples
/styles // Global and component-specific styles
/next.config.mjs // Next.js configuration

The app uses the following technologies:

- Next.js for the overall framework
- React for building UI components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React-icons for button icons
- GitHub Pages for deployment
- HTML2Canvas for generating printable PDFs
- All the code was written by ChatGPT-4.

Ensure comments are retained in your responses, always output the full file, not just a snippet of the change required.

Here's what I want to work on next: [describe your new feature, bug fix, or improvement].
